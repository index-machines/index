## What is Index?

Index is an open source Pick and Place (PnP) machine being developed by Stephen Hawes. The Index is designed to be low cost and be controlled by [OpenPnP](https://openpnp.org/). 

## What you'll build

This tutorial will take you through the build of the Index Pick and Place machine from parts to an assembled frame with the electronics installed. 

Your final Index will be ready for connection to OpenPnP. It will look similar to the following:
