  The left side provides the rails on which the Y gantry runs. In addition, most of the cables are routed to the front left of the machine as that is where the controller ultimately lives.

The frame build will not install the motion or electrical components unless they must be installed before the mechanical components of an assembly can be completed. In those cases, they will be noted during the assembly stage.

## Necessary Components & Tools

Collect the necessary items to build the left side of the frame. These are:

* 1x Left Front Leg (FDM-0001-00_front-left-leg_Body_001)
* 1x Left Back Leg (FDM-0003-00_back-left-leg_Body_001)
* 2x 20mm x 20mm Aluminum V-Slot - 600mm
* 6x M5x10mm Machine Screw
* 8x M5 Slot Nuts
* 3mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver

## Assembly

1. Take the Left Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted.

2. Take the assembly and turn it so that you are looking directly at the ends of the v-slot opposite to the attached Left Back Leg.

* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot of the top rail (label A) from the open end. 
* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot on the bottom rail (label E) from the open end. Note: These will be used later when joining the two side assemblies.
* Insert one slot nut into the right slot on the bottom rail (label F) from the open end. 
* Insert three slot nuts into the left slot of the bottom rail (label H) from the open end. 

3. Take the Left Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Left Back Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.

4. On the top rail, position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

5. On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

6. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.
