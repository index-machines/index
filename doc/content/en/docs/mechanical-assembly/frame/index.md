## Assembly

1. Take the left side assembly and from the end with the back leg, insert two slot nuts into the bottom slot of the lower rail from the open end.

2. Attach the Body Umbilical Guide using two M5x10mm machine screws which are inserted through the holes in the umbilical guide into slots.

3. Take a new v-slot extrusion and insert two slot nuts into one of the slots from the end.
4. With the v-slot containing the slot nuts facing the front of the machine, insert the v-slot extrusion (in green below) into the left front leg underneath the bottom rail.

5. Position a slot nut underneath the hole and use a M5x10mm machine screw to fasten the v-slot extrusion in place.

6. Place the right side onto the opposite end of the v-slot extrusion (in green) so that the mounting hole is in line with the v-slot.

7. Position the slot nut underneath the hole in the right front leg and use a M5x10mm machine screw to fasten the v-slot extrusion in place.

8. Take the remaining v-slot extrusion and on one side insert two slot nuts.
9. Use these slot nuts along with the M5x8mm machine screws to connect a 2020 corner bracket near each end of the extrusion. Adjust the tightness so they're snug but can still be moved.
10. Insert a slot nut into the bottom slot of the bottom rail on the left side.

11. Place the v-slot with the corner connectors (shown in green) against the bottom rail and insert a M5x8mm nut through the corner connector into the slot nut to connect the bottom rail with the cross piece.

12. Insert a slot nut into the bottom slot of the bottom rail on the right side (see step 10 for an image if needed).
13. Place the v-slot with the corner connector against the bottom rail on the right assembly and insert a M5x8mm nut through the corner connector into the slot nut to connect the bottom rail with the cross piece.
14. Line up the ends of the cross piece with the bottom rails and tighten.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
The frame needs to be square for the gantry to work properly. When the gantry is installed, you will want to adjust this back cross-piece to ensure that the frame is square.
