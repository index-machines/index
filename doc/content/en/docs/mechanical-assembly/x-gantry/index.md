## Assembly

1. Insert a M5 Hex Nut into one of the hex nut locations on the X gantry back and push into the 3d print.

2. Pull the hex nut fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into it from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for the remaining five M5 nut locations.

14. Tighten the nylon lock nuts on the machine screws so that the two sides are snug against the V-slot rollers.
15. Place a Linear Rail onto the X gantry front and line up the holes with the three holes on the left.

22. Place a M5x45mm machine screw through the GT2 idler, the z axis roller spacer and into the X gantry front.
{{< container-image path="images/7b28d6f03444095.png" alt="" >}}
23. Secure this machine screw to the gantry by tightening it into M5 nut inserted in step 9.
24. Place the GT2 Pulley onto the motor shaft and use some belt to adjust the height to match the idler.

25. Tighten the pulley into place using the grub screws.
26. To the left linear rail attach the Z Gantry Left using four M3x6mm Machine Screws.
27. To the right linear rail attach the mirrored Z Gantry Left using four M3x6mm Machine Screws.
28. Ensure the 3.3V power supply is off.
29. Connect the black wire from the limit switch to the 3.3V power source ground or negative terminal
30. Connect the red wire from the limit switch to the 3.3V power source positive terminal.
31. Power on the 3.3V power supply
32. Move the right side gantry to the top so that it triggers the limit switch (which illuminates an LED)
33. Move the left side gantry to the bottom extent of travel.
34. Take the GT2 belt and insert one end so that just under half the teeth on the top of the left side gantry are gripping the teeth on the belt.
35. Pull the belt towards the motor pulley and then around the pulley
36. Ensure the belt is taut and insert into the teeth on the right side gantry (mirrored Z Gantry Left)
37. Continue to direct the belt down towards the idler and around
38. Direct the belt back to the left gantry and pull taught.
39. Place over the teeth at the side of the gantry and determine a cut location on the belt
40. Cut the belt so that you can insert into the teeth of the gantry part
41. Insert the teeth into the gantry part ensuring that the belt it taut
