## Assembly

1. Take the Right Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted (See Left Side Assembly Step 1 for an example).
2. Take the assembly and turn it so that you are looking directly at the ends of the v-slot opposite the attached Right Back Leg.

* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot of the top rail (label A) from the open end.
* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot on the bottom rail (label E) from the open end. Note: These will be used later when joining the two side assemblies.
* Insert three slot nuts into the right slot of the bottom rail (label F) from the open end.
* Insert one slot nut into the left slot on the bottom rail (label H) from the open end.

3. Take the Right Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Right Back Leg.
4. On the top rail, position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

5. On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.
